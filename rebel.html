      <!-- Notable Mechanics -->
      <h2>Notable Mechanics:</h2>
      <p>(!) means a mechanic to particularly watch out for</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Banished Spear (!)</strong> - Throws a spear at your sinner with the highest Attack, that deals damage continuously in a 3x3 area.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Place your highest Attack sinner in the top right corner (Marked O). After the boss throws the spear at them, move them back to a more favourable position.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Raging Blizzard (!)</strong> - Massive AOE damage if the core is not broken quickly enough.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Break as fast as possible, if you are unable to do so and are dying to this Attack. Consider bringing a healer.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Deadly Tsunami</strong> - Unavoidable AOE damage. Will perform after reaching 80% or lower HP, and after recovering from break.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Piercing Icicle</strong> - High single target damage to your highest HP unit.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> You can avoid this damage by moving. However, it's not scary enough to demand it.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Mania Rift</strong> - Summons 3 Sand Worms (each with 3x cores).<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Bring Labyrinth.</p>

      <br>

      <div class="stage-image">

      </div>

      <h2>Enemies of Note:</h2>
      <p><strong>HUSH-8 (1x Wave 1, 1x Wave 3)</strong> - The big guys reveal their cores after losing roughly 20% of their HP. When they do, they will also generate a 3x3 shield, which negates Normal Attack damage from sinners outside the shield. They can also stun your sinners.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Don't rush to break the core, if it means compromising your corebreak on the boss. The boss shows his core quickly enough, that you can usually tank this elite, and break him alongside the boss. You can also dodge the stun by quickly moving your sinners while he is jumping in the air.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>HUSH-47 (1x Wave 1, 1x Wave 2, 1x Wave 3)</strong> - 2 of these guys are gonna spawn on the left-hand side, away from all the action. They will teleport to the sinner furthest away from them after losing 20% of their HP.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Enemy HP -20% makes these guys jump instantly. If not available, try having a strong normal attacker lower their HP, to force them to jump to a sinner close to the boss. Break these guys sooner rather than later. (The 3rd one will spawn close to the boss, and will usually die collaterally, or at the very least be forced to teleport immediately). Alternatively, the two guys on the left can also be completely ignored, which may simplify the stage greatly for some people. As long as the boss is killed within a reasonable time, this still scores 240k+.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Garden Apothecary (3x Wave 2, 3x Wave 3)</strong> - Enemies with very far Attack range.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Avoid having a sinner standing to the right of the middle spawner as much as possible (Marked X), as this will prevent the enemies from walking forward. Once they have taken a step forward, you can place Nox down to Attack them or kill them collaterally with something like Deren ECB.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>General Strategies:</h2>
      <p>Enemy HP -20% is a very potent buff as it makes dealing with the left-side elites much easier. I recommend taking it over Boss HP, when able. Because of the summoned Sandworms, Labyrinth becomes an absolute machine of destruction, it is not recommended to leave her out of the team unless you know what you are doing.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Nox + Laby Base Package</h3>
      <p>This team is all about setting up Laby for perfection. Even if you ignore the 2 left side elites, the initial HUSH-8 spawn, alongside the boss summoning Sandworms, means we can chain together 12+ Laby ultimates during the boss' core broken duration, dealing insane amounts of damage. I highly recommend looking up on YouTube for examples of how this can be set up.</p>

      </div>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Bleed</h3>
      <p>Use Levy to tank the HUSH-8's. Handle the Garden Apothecaries through Dreya ECB (and/or collateral Dreya ultis). The team runs super smoothly here as long as you add something like a Laby to trivialise the core breaking. Your goal is simply to maximize the number of Dreya ultis you throw during the boss' core broken phase (Aim for 3x ideally).</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Coquelic</h3>
      <p>Very straightforward team, as long as Pricilla and Lady Pearl are on the team. Everything is essentially guaranteed to die within the 10 second showdown. First things first should be to Flower Pearl, then Pricilla gets a Flower after she uses her ultimate and summons her ECB. Pearl is also an excellent solution to the Garden Apothecaries.<br>
      <em>Note:</em> Make sure Coquelic (& Pricilla & Pearl if possible) are standing within Pearl's Passive 2, for the damage amplification.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>McQueen</h3>
      <p>Thanks to Laby's overwhelming boss-killing power, McQueen doesn't need a ton of help killing the boss this time around. Instead, focus on maximizing the contribution of each individual clone.</p>
