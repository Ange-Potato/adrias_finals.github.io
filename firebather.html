      <!-- Notable Mechanics -->
      <h2>Notable Mechanics:</h2>
      <p>(!) means a mechanic to particularly watch out for</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Commander (!)</strong> - Requires 2x Block!<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Hecate ECB, Eve Bear, owo gain a lot of value because of this. However, if those are unavailable, a generic solution is to give a sinner the Crimebrands <em>Depths of Restricted Area</em> & <em>Bulwark</em> (both gold CBs), in order to tank him.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Stomp (!)</strong> - Big Physical Damage hit, in addition to stun.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Move the tanking unit while he is performing this move to dodge it entirely!</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Battle Frenzy (!)</strong> - After he has attacked (not counting Stomp) 5x times, he will reveal his cores and start spinning, attacking everything within his 3x3 (he can & may also still use Stomp).<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> After he has revealed his cores, move away your tanking unit. As long as he isn't being blocked, he won't attack you.</p>

      <br>

      <div class="stage-image">
        <img src="images/Guide/Firebather stage.jpg" alt="Firebather Stage">
      </div>

      <h2>Enemies of Note:</h2>
      <p><strong>Fire Thrower - Deteriorated (1x Wave 2)</strong> - 3x Cores. Global Attack Range. Big AOE damage. Horrible Spawn Position (Marked X). This guy is everything you should hate. He reveals his cores after his HP has dropped to around 60%, which is a lot of damage to ask for. Essentially a 2nd boss for the stage.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> You can dodge his AOE Firebomb by moving the targeted sinner.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p><strong>Exotic Musician - Deteriorated (1x Wave 2)</strong> - 3x Cores. Heals. Horrible Spawn Position (Marked O). The 3rd boss of the stage, and one of the highest priorities to break and kill as soon as possible, otherwise she will just keep healing the boss and undoing your work. Also shows her cores around the 60% mark. If you have found yourself struggling to kill the boss, this woman is most likely the reason.<br>
      <em>Tip:</em> Kill her ASAP...</p>

      <br>

      <h2>General Strategies:</h2>
      <p>Enemy HP -20% is the best buff here, the jumpstart on the elite damage is an incredibly important aid.<br>
      Because of the importance of dealing with the elites alongside the boss, units like <strong>Shalom, Serpent & Eleven</strong> gain a lot of value. As they are able to deal substantial amounts of damage to the elites without compromising their boss damage.<br>
      It's strongly recommended to not let the Boss walk too far forward, as most of the high-end teams rely on being able to deal damage to the boss and the elites in one fell swoop.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Shalom</h3>
      <p>Shalom does what Shalom does best. Her passive multi-target auto attacks and her incredible AOE burst make her able to deal with the elites easily. She can be accompanied by just about anything, 2L is especially great here as Lamia can handle the left side for Shalom, and Luvia Ray can finish the boss damage. Alternatively, you can supply Shalom with pure ampers, however, beware that you may overload her (or you), in handling the left side and right side simultaneously. Serpent is another valuable mention here, as she is also OP in this stage for similar reasons.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>2LS</h3>
      <p>Make sure Lamia tags all the small adds (and all the Elites when she has the chance). Make sure Serpent is always in range of spinning on both the Elites and the Boss, and that they are all within her ECB (the boss has a very generous hitbox, abuse it!). From there, Luvia and Serpent should be able to take down the boss, while Serpent and Lamia take down the elites. The team is a bit micro heavy on the Lamia movement + AC, but is rewarded handsomely for it.<br>
      <em>Note:</em> If using 2L+ (any DPS), make sure you have a plan for the elites. Lamia's own damage will not be enough to force their core reveal at an appropriate time, so the additional DPS you are bringing needs to cover that weakness.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>3E</h3>
      <p>Amazing right-side control on this team. They do struggle a bit on waves 1 and 3, so it's recommended to bring someone to alleviate that pressure, however, it's not fully necessary (especially not at S1). This team just runs as it usually does, hyperbuff Eleven, break the boss, Eleven ECB, Fear Chain (can ignore if S1).<br>
      <em>Note:</em> If using S0 Eleven and Eve, Boss Damage can be quite tight even with good fear chaining, similarly, the Elites may survive. The absolute best addition here is Serpent (or Shalom obviously), who can compensate for the awkward waves 1 and 3 while fixing the general damage issues present on the boss and elites.</p>
